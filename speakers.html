In-car entertainment has come a long way since 1930, 
when Motorola introduced the first commercially successful car radio, 
the Model 5T71. Over the past 80-plus years, car audio has evolved from the basic AM radio receiver with a single speaker to complex electronic systems reproducing music and other entertainment from both over-the-air signals and recorded formats. Many systems today can play music from a staggering array of audio sources: radio, CD, portable music players like the iPod, USB flash drives, SD cards, Bluetooth audio and hard-disk drives.The overwhelming number of audio choices can make the average consumer's head spin. This five-part series, "Understanding Car Audio Systems," will give you a grasp on the basics of today's multifaceted "infotainment" systems. You may also want to check out "How To Shop for an Aftermarket Car Audio System." Even if you plan to keep your car's stock sound system intact, a good understanding of aftermarket car audio options can be helpful when you're new-car shopping — especially if you're tempted to buy a premium factory system.
n recent years, automakers have really stepped up their game with their original equipment manufacturer (OEM) systems. But no matter how complex it is, every car audio system consists of three main components. The first is the radio or "head unit" that controls the entire system and generates the audio signal. The second is an amplifier that increases the strength of the audio signal so that it can drive the third component, the speakers that reproduce the sound.
