The function of a Silencer in Vehicle is to cool the exhaust gases by expansion through it and to reduce the noise of outgoing gases. The exhaust gases must be discharged into the atmosphere with minimum restriction. The restriction in flow of exhaust gases causes back pressure.Back pressure on piston head during exhaust stroke due to restriction of flow of exhaust gases. It is generally 0.7 - 0.9 Kg/cm2 at maximum rpm. The back pressure at low value by proper designing of exhaust system. High back pressure results in higher bhp loss at particular speed, Dilution of fresh charge with exhaust gases, Increased fuel consumption. Back pressure can be reduced by proper design which may become bulky and costly. The exhaust manifold are made of cast iron or steel. Bend should be such made as to give minimum restriction. Muffler design have internal baffles which restrict the flow of gases and cause back pressure. It reduce noise effectively with more rise in back pressure.When exhaust gases are removed ouside the combustion chamber  at the end of the combustion process, the gases move into the exhaust manifold at high pressure and at a considerably high speed.If these gases are released into the atmosphere without controlling their flow and speed, they make a loud noise which is unbearable. In order to supress that unbearable sound, a 'silencer' is introduced into the exhaust system of a vehicle.a silencer controls the flowing direction of the high pressure exhaust gases and release them into the atmosphere in such a manner so that minimum noise is produced.When an  engine runs, hig pressure exhaust gas is released. This causes a  pressure wave in the air causing and explosion very fast to form a  steady noise. The main function of Silencers is to reduce his noise and to transmit exhaust gases to the atmosphere But it also serves some more function like : Decrease fuel consumption 
It usually has some form of a catalytic converter, which converts the exhaust gases into more environment friendly gases.It silences or rather dulls the sound of the exhaust.It can also be used as a performance booster. A free flowing exhaust will allow for better partial vacuums for the intake stroke thus giving a slight edge in performance.
