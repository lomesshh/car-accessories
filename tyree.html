Tyre have a code system moulded into their sidewall which allows you to understand their 
technical capabilities. This code provides information on tyre size, construction, 
its load-carrying capacity and its speed rating.
205 indicates the nominal section width of the tyre in millimetres.A tire
or tyre is a ring-shaped component that surrounds a wheel's rim to transfer a vehicle's
load from the axle through the wheel to the ground and to provide traction on the surface traveled over. Most tires, such as those for automobiles and bicycles, 
are pneumatically inflated structures, which also provide a flexible cushion that absorbs shock as the tire rolls over rough features on the surface. Tires provide a footprint that is designed to match the weight of the vehicle
with the bearing strength of the surface that it rolls over by providing a bearing pressure that will not deform the surface excessively. 
The materials of modern pneumatic tires are synthetic rubber, natural rubber, fabric and wire, along with carbon black and other chemical compounds. They consist of a tread and a body. The tread provides traction while the body provides containment for a quantity of compressed air. Before rubber was developed, the first versions of tires were simply bands of metal fitted around wooden wheels to prevent wear and tear. Early rubber tires were solid (not pneumatic). Pneumatic tires are used on many types of vehicles, including cars, bicycles, motorcycles, buses, trucks, heavy equipment, and aircraft. Metal tires are still used on locomotives and railcars, and solid rubber (or other polymer) tires are still used in various non-automotive applications, such as some casters, carts, lawnmowers, and wheelbarrows.
