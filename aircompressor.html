A compressor is a device that compresses and cools down the air. It's not a necessary equipment in cars, but car manufacturers install compressors to the cars to get the maximum work done by the engine, resulting in possibility to manufacturing cars with smaller capacity engines and hence increasing fuel economy of the vehicle. Air compressors collects the air that is released in the exhaust stroke of a 4 stroke engine (if you want to know about different strokes and then the air is cooled down in the compressor. The compressed air is then sent back to the engine which provides the engine with excess air and hence providing more oxygen for combustion. This results in power boost. The exhaust air can't be sent back directly to the engine because cool air is denser than hot air and exhaust air is hot. For combustion, cool air is more suitable as it's denser and contains more molecules of oxygen gas.air conditioning compressor (driven from belt drive from engine crankshaft) compresses refrigerant for cooling interior of car.air compressor accessory (driven by electric motor from battery) to pressurize tires when low, or to pressureize air shiocks for greater lift.
Air compressor to compress engine air intake for superchargers and turbo chargers allowing combusting more fuel in the same sized cylinders (for power boost). This can be driven by exhaust gasses or from the crankshaft (one is turbo the other is super, can’t remember which is which)
