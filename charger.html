Most people carry a smartphone, tablet, GPS unit, or other USB-powered device in the car, meaning that if you drive it’s worth having a dedicated USB charger that plugs into your car’s 12-volt accessory outlet (the “cigarette lighter,” for older folks).
Even if your car has a USB port for integrating music playback and phone calls with your car stereo, and even if that port can charge your phone, spending $15 or so for a dedicated charger can be worth it. That’s because the built-in USB port(s) in most cars put out only 1 amp of current, which isn’t enough to charge a tablet or even newer smartphones at full speed: If you’re running an app like Waze or Google Maps, using your car’s USB port may not charge your phone faster than it uses power, so you can end up at your destination with the same battery level as when you got into the car. Even if your car’s USB port does offer higher-speed charging, most cars have only one USB charging port; a charger like our pick lets you charge two or more devices from a single accessory outlet—your family and friends will appreciate that.
Similarly, if you have a USB charger that you bought a couple of years ago, it probably puts out only 1 amp—our pick puts out up to 2.4 amps, meaning that upgrading will provide you with faster charge times and the capability to power up tablets and other high-current devices. The same applies if your charger has only a single USB port: We’re living in a multi-device age, so it makes sense to have multiple USB charging ports. And if you got your charger from a bin at a gas station counter or drugstore, there’s a good chance that it’s poorly made—and perhaps even unsafe for you or your gear.
