Modern air filters block up to 98 percent of dust, pollen and other contaminants to keep your engine healthy. A high-quality air filter can grab dust particles down to 5.5 microns in diameter – compared to about 50 microns for the average human hair.
If the car’s air filter isn't doing its job, then dirt can enter the engine and make its way into the oil supply over time. This can wreak havoc on expensive internal components of the engine, such as the valves and valve seats, piston rings and cylinder walls.
Even before causing expensive damage, a dirty air filter can reduce the airflow into the engine, robbing your vehicle of power, reducing performance and fuel economy. That's why some racecars run without any air filter; they'd rather risk damage to the engine than risk reducing horsepower and throttle response from constricted airflow through a dirty filter.
Air filters are typically made of a paper-like fiber with accordion pleats to increase the surface area. However, there are also foam filters on the market, and lifetime filters sometimes use oil-soaked cotton fibers. In many older domestic cars, the air filter was shaped like a ring and mounted on top of the engine. Inspecting and changing the filter was easy because the air filter cover was held on with one wing nut. Today, the air filter in most cars is usually a rectangular cartridge sealed in a plastic box that's part of a sophisticated air intake system. Still, replacing an air filter can be relatively easy, requiring you to only remove a few screws or clips.
Filter manufacturers recommend replacing an air filter every 12,000 miles, but you should also check your vehicle's owner's manual for the manufacturer's guidelines. Keep in mind that more demanding driving conditions – such as idling in heavy traffic, driving on dusty roads or towing heavy loads – can put a strain on engines, so you may need to change the filter sooner than recommended. Stop-and-go traffic around town is considered heavy-duty use, so the family soccer van may deserve the same maintenance regimen as an airport taxi.
