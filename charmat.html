Vehicle mats generally come in two options: either rubber or carpet fabric. These differ in a number of ways, and each material provides advantages and disadvantages when compared to the other. For instance, carpet mats are generally tufted and have a rubberised anti-slip backing, while rubber mats are heavier duty and more durable.
Also, some car mats are the plain colour of rubber, while many others contain branded company logos, cartoon characters, or advertisements. They can also come in a wide range of colours.
The terms "universal" and "custom fit" differentiate between floor mats that will fit a multitude of different cars versus those that are specifically designed to fit only one chassis
Some styles of mats may feature small, flexible spikes on their underside to grip carpeting underneath. A more common method of retention, though, is a fitting system that hooks, clips, or twists into an anchor point already positioned on the vehicle floor This anchor is typically pre-installed by the OEM but some aftermarket manufacturers of "custom fit" mats also provide this. Many makeshift vehicle mats are becoming more popular, often taking the form of PVC alternatives, but rubber vehicle mats are still seen as the safest option.
